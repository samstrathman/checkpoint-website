                <h1>hi, my name is sam</h1>
                <p>back when i was 8 my parents asked me what instrument i wanted to learn.
                    i had seen my uncle play the guitar my whole life and was
                    incredibly fascinated by it, so that's what i went with. i started 
                    with classical music, then moved towards more rock and progressive metal, 
                    and ended up at fingerstyle acoustic music. 

                    video games have always been a huge part of my life. i was a big Nintendo
                    fanboy growing up and
                    when i was 13 i discovered this little game that was still in beta: 
                    minecraft. i poured so many hours into that game, and it lead
                    me down the rabbit hole of indie games. i have so much 
                    respect for indie game devs, they showed me that you don't need a 
                    massive team to make something, you just need some drive and time and
                    a ton of patience. they also showed me that you don't need to be 
                    and man the artists that i discovered through indie games are absolutely top notch. 
                    people like C418 (minecraft), Disasterpeace (fez), Scott Lloyd Shelly (Terraria),
                    Austin Wintory (Journey).
                    i can't overstate how important these musicians were to my child self.
                    at around 14 or 15 i started writing music. at that point i was
                    really into quiet ambient stuff (probably because i was playing so
                    much minecraft at the time), so that's what i started writing.
                    piano music, ironically. it's still some of the most meaningful stuff to me.
                    i started a music project called Desosign and 
                    over the years i tried out a bunch of different genres, 
                    which you can check out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4NuzClKtuggwW0KjTTcrUS?si=D-N7TwmITrqDjsRnJ-TJJA">here.</a>
                    that music is okay, some of it i'm proud of some of it not so much, but 
                    it was just nice to have a project like that where i could kind
                    of try out whatever i wanted. in 2020 however i decided that i wanted
                    a music project that was more cohesive, more polished, and something that
                    was as true to me as possible, something that would combine my love for video games and game soundtracks 
                    with the guitar and production skills i had built up over the years,
                    and thus checkpoint was born. 
                    i spent the next year learning basic 3d art and animation with blender
                    and writing checkpoint's debut ep, and i'm super proud of it. 
                    i'm nearly done with my next release, so stay tuned!

                    </p>
                <p>i'm a huge supporter of indie games and it's been a dream of mine to write the soundtrack a game, so if you're 
                    looking for someone send me a message through the contact section!
