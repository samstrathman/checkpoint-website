                <h1>hi, my name is sam</h1>
                <p class="indent">when i was 8 my parents asked me what instrument i wanted to learn. i had seen my uncle play the guitar and thought it was neat so that's what i chose, and i loved it. growing up i bounced around to a bunch of different styles, from classical to rock to fingerstyle acoustic. playing guitar was one of the things i spent a lot of my free time on as a child.</p>
                <p class="indent">the other thing i spent a lot of my free time on as a child was video games, so when i was 14 and stumbled across this relatively unknown game called Minecraft with its sandbox gameplay and unusual minimalistic soundtrack, it blew me away. it introduced me to the incredible world of indie games and indie game soundtracks, and some of the best music i had ever heard.</p>
                <p class="indent">about a year later i got my first daw and started composing music and learning music production. this became my go-to hobby, and i was absoutely awful at it, but i loved it. and as the years went on and i finished album after album, i began to notice some improvement.</p>
                <p class="indent">so then a decade passed. i had been releasing music under the name desosign (which you can check out <a href="https://desosign.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> if you want, some of it's good and some isn't), but i could never really stick to one specific sound. i liked exploring genres as they caught my interest. however, in 2020 i decided that i wanted to start a new music project, one that was a bit more cohesive and polished, one that would combine my love for games with the guitar and production skills i had been building up over the years. and that's how checkpoint was born.</p>
                <p class="indent">i spent the next year writing/producing checkpoint's debut ep, as well as learning basic 3d art and animation with blender to capture a specific atmosphere (a nod to the low poly 3d games of my childhood). this is the biggest project i have ever worked on, and i couldn't be happier with how it is turning out. i hope you get as much enjoyment listening to the music as i did making it :)</p>
                <p class="indent">thank you for taking the time to read this and check out some music, it really means a lot <3</p>
                <p class="indent">also it's always been a dream of mine to write the soundtrack for a game, so if you're looking for someone send me a message through the contact section!</p>
